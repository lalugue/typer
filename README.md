## ðŸŽ® How to play
1. Visit [https://typerapp.now.sh/](https://typerapp.now.sh/)
2. To start a game, type "start"

You now have **10 seconds** to type out all the words displayed. For every word you type correctly, your score increases, and you also get **1 extra second**. Can you beat my highscore of 16? (you probably can)
